Instructions for running:

Before running:
To make the Python file executable use:
 $cd RobTech/src/keyboard_reader/scripts
 $chmod +x move_bot2.py

Then:

1. Run $roslaunch husky_gazebo husky_empty_world.launch (I couldn't run husky_playpen.launch on my laptop)

2. In new Terminal $rosrun keyboard_reader move_bot2

3. In new Terminal $rosrun keyboard_reader keyboard_event_publisher 

Optional: In new Terminal rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph - to  create a dynamic graph

Explanation:

I use the keyboard reader driver to detect weather a key is pressed.
The node move_bot2 subscribes to keyboard's Key messages. When a key is pressed (a new message has arrived) the subsriber calls the callback function. 
In the callback function at the beginning a flag State is set as False meaning the Husky is not moving.
When a key is pressed State = True the Husky moves (linear.x = 1).
When any key is pressed again State = False and the Husky stops (linear.x = 0).

I publish message of type Twist on the topic husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel
(rostopic list gives multiple cmd_vel, so I used http://wiki.ros.org/husky_base where it says we should use this topic 'husky_velocity_controller/cmd_vel').
So I publish data on that topic which enables me to move the Husky in Gazebo.
